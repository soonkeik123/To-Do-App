# To-Do-App

This To-Do App is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. With features like adding, filtering, and deleting To-Do items, this app provides a seamless user experience for organizing daily tasks.

# Learning Outcome

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Flutter widgets and improved my skills in using classes and methods efficiently. This project, inspired by an online tutorial, demonstrated excellent coding practices, including organizing code into separate folder like pages, widgets, models, and constants, making the codebase clean and maintainable.

# Improvement

One area of improvement identified is the handling of completed tasks. Currently, ticked To-Do items stay in their original position, which can cause confusion or inconvenience for users. A future improvement would be to move all completed tasks to the bottom of the list for better organization and user experience.
